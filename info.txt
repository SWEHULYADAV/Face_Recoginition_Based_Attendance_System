How Face Recognition-based Attendance Systems Work
Face recognition technology involves analyzing and identifying a person’s facial features using advanced algorithms.
It captures and compares unique facial characteristics, such as the distance between the eyes, the shape of the nose, and the contours of the face.
This technology has come a long way and is now capable of near-instantaneous recognition with remarkable accuracy.
They use a camera to capture an individual’s face, analyze the facial features, and compare them with a database of pre-registered faces.
If a match is found, attendance is recorded. These systems can also adapt to variations in lighting, facial expressions, and aging, ensuring reliability.


Line 1-9: We are importing the required libraries.
Line 11-12: Defining the Flask App.
Line 14-15: We are defining a constant ‘nimgs‘ which defines how many images to capture for each user while registering.
Line 17-18: Getting today’s date to use in the program ahead.
Line 21-22: Loading the ‘haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml‘ HaarCascade file to detect faces.
Line 25-34: Checking if the required folders are in place or not, If not create them. Also, create today’s attendance file if it’s not present in the Attendance folder.
totalreg(): A function that counts the total number of registered users.
extract_faces(): A function that extracts the face from an image. It uses the HaarCascade file we loaded above.
identify_face(): A function that identifies the faces in the given image using the trained KNN model.
train_model(): A function that trains the KNN model on all the faces available in the faces folder.
extract_attendance(): A function that extracts information from today’s attendance file in the attendance folder.
add_attendance(): A function that adds the Attendance of a specific user in today’s Attendance file.
Routing Functions:

home(): Our main page routing function.
start(): Our main function that will take attendance when we click on the Take Attendance Button.
add(): Function to add a new user.
The last 2 lines are to run the Flask App.
